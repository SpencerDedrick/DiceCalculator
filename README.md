Dice Rolling App
This is a dice rolling app  I made for my friends to use.
There is a text to dice roll element that follows a traditional tabletop RPG format. 
Example "2d6 + 1d8" would roll 2 d6 dice and 1d8 die and add the results.

There is also a log that tracks the result of each roll and allows notes to be added to each roll.
