Dice Rolling App
This is a dice rolling app  I made for my friends to use.
There is a text to dice roll element that follows a traditional tabletop RPG format. 
Example "2d6 + 1d8" would roll 2 d6 dice and 1d8 die and add the results.

There is also a log that tracks the result of each roll and allows notes to be added to each roll.

Update 9-14-2019:
I have changed the format of the app to be more like a calculator.
After learning more and following some more tutorials I have implemented a calculator style to the app.  I believe this will not only look better but also have better responsiveness.

Update 9-15-2019:
Added some much needed mobile responsiveness. Looking to update history with the ability to add annotations/notes soon.
